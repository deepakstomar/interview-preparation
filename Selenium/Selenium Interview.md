**Q. What is Selenium?**

**A.** Selenium is open-source suite of tools and libraries that is used for browser automation.

- It allows users to test their websites functionality on different browsers.
- Perform Cross browser testing to check if the website functions consistently across different browser.
- It provides a single interface that lets you write test scripts in programming  languages like Ruby, Java, NodeJS, PHP, Python, JavaScript, among others.
- Selenium is very extensible and can be integrated with other tools and frameworks like TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber, etc.


**Q. Importance of Testing is Selenium?**

- Manual testing can be time-consuming and prone to human errors.
- **Selenium Automation** allows testing to be executed quickly and accurately, reduce human errors and ensuring consistent test results.

- Selenium allows developers and testers to automate the testing of web applications across different browsers and platforms.

1. **Language Support:** Selenium allows you to create test scripts in different languages.
2. **Browser Support:** Selenium enables you to test your website on different browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari etc.
3. **Scalability:** 
4. **Reusable Test Scripts:** Selenium allows users to create reusable test script that can be used across different test cases and projects. This reusability saves times and effort in test script creation and maintenance.
5. **Parallel Testing:** Selenium supports parallel test execution, allowing multiple tests to run concurrently. This helps to reduce the overall  testing time,  making development process more efficient.
6. **Documentation and Reporting:** Selenium provides detailed test execution logs and reports, making it easier to track test results and identify areas that require attention.
7. **User Experience Testing:** Selenium can simulate user interactions and behaviour, allowing testers to assess the user experience and ensure that the application is intuitive and user-friendly.
8. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Selenium can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing of each code change. This integration helps identify and address issues earlier in the development cycle, allowing for faster and more reliable releases.

### Components of Selenium
- Selenium Suite has 3 components
	1. Selenium IDE
	2. Selenium WebDriver
	3. Selenium Grid
1. **Selenium IDE:**
  - Selenium IDE is Chrome and Firefox plugin. Primary use of IDE is to record user interactions such as clicks, selections etc in the browser and plays them as automate tests.
  - It then generates the test script (of the automation test) in programming languages like Java and Python.
  - Selenium IDE helps in:
  	- Creating automated test scripts and validating them at speed
  	- Identifying and highlighting errors during the replay of interactions
  	- Cross Browser testing
2. **Selenium WebDriver:**
  - Selenium WebDriver is a powerful and enhanced version of RC which was developed to overcome limitations of Selenium RC.
  - a
3. **Selenium Grid:** Selenium Grid is smart proxy server that allows QAs to run tests in parallel on multiple machine. This is done by routing commands to remote web browser instances, where one server acts as the hub. This hub routes test commands that are JSON format to multiple registered Grid nodes.



**Q. What is automation testing?**

- Automation testing is the process of using specialised software to control the execution of tests and compare the results with expected outcomes.
	- Automation testing can help to reduce time, cost, and effort required to test software applications by automating repetitive tasks and allowing tester to focus on more critical test cases.



**Q. What are limitation of Selenium Testing?**

- Unavailability of reliable tech support: Since Selenium is an open-source tool, it does not have dedicated tech support to resolve the user queries.
- Tests web applications only: Selenium needs to integrate with third-party tools like **Appium** and **TestNG** to test desktop and mobile applications.
- Limited support for image testing.
- No built-in reporting and test management facility: Selenium has to be integrated with tools like TestNG, or JUnit among others to facilitate test reporting and management.
- Require the knowledge of programming language: Selenium WebDriver expects the user to have some basic knowledge about programming.
