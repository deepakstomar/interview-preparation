#### Q. What is BDD, and how is it different from TDD?
- BDD (Behaviour driven development) is a software development methodology that emphasizes defining the  expected behaviour of the software using human-readable language, facilitating collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- While TDD (Test driven development) focuses on writing tests before code and is more develop centric.
- BDD extends TDD by concentrating on the software's behaviour and fostering communication among developers, testers and business analysts.
#### Q. What are the key benefits of using BDD?
- The key benefits of using BDD includes
	1. improved communication & collaboration among team members
	2. Shared understanding of software requirements
	3. Clearer & more maintainable documentation
	4. Faster feedback & higher-quality software with fewer defects.
#### Q. Feature vs Scenario?
- Feature provides a broad overview of what the software should do, scenario provides concrete example of how software should behave in specific situation.
- Feature
	- A feature is high-level description of functionality or behaviour of software being developed.
- Scenario
	- A scenario is a specific example that demonstrates the behaviour of a feature in a particular situation or context.
	- It outline a sequence of steps, expressed in Given-When-Then format, that describe the expected behaviour of the feature.
